[Commons VFS](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/) provides a single API for accessing various different file systems. It presents a uniform view of the files from various different sources.

This library mainly includes a VFS2 provider implementation for different online storage services:
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/it/)
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

Additionally, it contains useful methods for dealing with VFS2 aspects: FileObject entities, FileObject selectors/comparators and URI manipulation.
